\maketitle
Three university students have gotten together to revdelop Rather the web application. 
This development plan is a detailed structure of how we will develop this.
\section{Team Meeting Plan}
The team is going to meet twice a week on Tuesday and Thursday evening's for a minimum of two hours. Every team member is expected to bring an agenda with what they have accomplished and any issues they have encountered. Each section of code developed will be passed on to the tester team member to ensure it works correctly. Any member who misses a meeting without a valid excuse needs to buy the group a coffee. The meetings will be adjourned with a work plan of what everyone is expected to do until the next meeting. This will allow much of the coding to be done on each members time to ensure a quality job is done. 
\section{Team Communication Plan}
The group will communicate through a variety of online methods. We will use git to communicate code updates, facebook to set up meetings, skype for online meetings, and google docs to work on documentation before it is translated to latek.
\section{Team Member Roles}
\subsection{Nik Novak- Lead developer}
The role of the lead developer is to control the code segments as they are developed. Each member will develop various sections of the code but the role of the lead developer is to over each piece. They will assign sections to various members during the development process. They will also oversee each section to ensure it is being held to coding standard and style. 
\subsection{Erin Varey - Quality Assurance developer}
The QA developer will be the predominant tester of each code segment. As sections are completed the QA will thoroughly test each section to ensure it is robust and functional. When the QA develops sections of code the lead developer will be the QA tester. 
\subsection{Joel Straatman- Scrum Master}
The group will attempt to follow the scrum structure. The scrum master will over see the whole process and keep up to date with various due dates. The scrum master will ensure the team follows the outline of goals as described in the gant chart and modify it as needed. 
\section{Git Workflow Plan}
Within our git hierarchy we will have it split into code and documentation. Every team member will pull the current code before working and then commit their changes every couple hours. Within our documentation each required document will get its own folder. The code will be broken up into functions that will be committed individually to make it easier to test and modularize. More subfolders in each branch will be created as needed. The repo was created by Nik Novak and will be maintained by everyone.
\section{Proof of Concept Demonstration Plan}
The group has some experience with Javascript and has developed a basic test plan that the QA will implement after every change. With regular meetings this code should be able to be completed in a reasonable timeframe. The scope of the project is small enough such that we can complete it and add additional features to continue to challenge ourselves.
\section{Technology}
This will be coded in Javascript and CSS using the IDE of choice. Every group member has a computer to work on and commit to git with.
\section{Coding Style}
We will use a modular coding style and tabs not spaces. The code will follow information hiding to ensure it is well designed. The group will test both blackbox and whitebox based on a test plan. Any scripting used for automation of testing will be written in nano.
