\subsection{Overview of Document}
\section{Plan}
The code will be tested both dynamically and statically. Every time a section is updated the auto testing script will be run to ensure it works. Once the final prototype is close to complete a focus group will be used to test dynamic components such as appearance. This will consist of them ranking components that will be listed on a survey.	
\subsection{Software Description}
\subsection{Test Team}
The Software will best tested by the developers along with a small focus group. The small focus group will consist of 3 volunteers who will test the code to prevent developer bias. 
\subsection{Automated Testing Approach}
Due to the nature of a web application the automated testing approach is going to be slightly complicated. It will consist of two components. A Java application for automation, and a Javascript script for testing the functions as required. The Java portion of the code will consist of automation that opens a Chrome browser and opens a webpage that will be used for testing. The program will then control the mouse to click the application and add a filter and then refresh the page. It will then execute the Javascript portion. This will consist of the unit testing scripts that will be written in Q-unit. 
\subsection{Testing Tools}
The only tool that is required for testing the application is a computer and a internet connection.
\subsection{Testing Schedule}

\section{System Test Description}
	
\subsection{Tests for Functional Requirements}
\subsubsection{Search Functionality}
		
\paragraph{Can the program search and replace text?}
\begin{enumerate}
\item{test-id1\\}
Type: Functional Static
					
Initial State: Fully Loaded Dog Wikipedia Page
					
Input: Words to block: Dog, Canine
Words to replace with: Elephant, Rooster
					
Output: The Wikipedia page will be reloaded with all the blocked words removed and randomly replaced with either Elephant or Rooster.
					
How test will be performed: The input will be inserted through the GUI for the web application. Then a search will be performed on the page for Dog and Canine to ensure the word doesn't occur anywhere
					
\item{test-id2\\}
Type: Functional Static
					
Initial State: A pre-made Twitter page that will be used for testing. The page will consist of four tweets. The link is attached below:

As seen this page contains a series of Tweets with various key words that will be used for testing.
					
Input:  Words to block: Donald Trump
Words to replace with: Puppies
					
Output: The page will be reloaded and all strings that orginally contained Donald Trump will have the word Puppies instead. 

How test will be performed: The input will be inserted through the GUI for the web application. Then a search will be performed on the page for Donald Trump to ensure the phrase doesn't occur anywhere.
\end{enumerate}
\subsubsection{Image Replacement}
\begin{enumerate}
\item{test-id1\\}
Type: Functional, Static
					
Initial State: Fully Loaded Dog Wikipedia Page
					
Input: Words to block: Dog, Canine
Words to replace with: Elephant, Rooster
					
Output: The Wikipedia page will be reloaded with all the dog images removed and replace with an image tagged with Elephant or Rooster.
					
How test will be performed: The input will be inserted through the GUI for the web application. It will search the <img> %% you need to escapse < and > chars to get them to render correctly
tags for the new source code and pass if the image has been replaced with one of the tagged words. 
					
\item{test-id2\\}
Type: Functional, Dynamic, Manual, Static etc. *******************************
					
Initial State: A pre-made Twitter page that will be used for testing. The page will consist of  a series tweets involving commonly used key words. The link is attached below:

As seen this page contains a series of Tweets with various key words that will be used for testing.
					
Input:  Words to block: Donald Trump
Words to replace with: Puppies
					
Output: The page will be reloaded and all Tweets that contain and image of Donald Trump will be replaced with a picture of a puppy.

How test will be performed: The input will be inserted through the GUI for the web application. It will search the <img> tags for the new source code and pass if the image has been replaced with one of the tagged words. 
\end{enumerate}
\subsubsection{Selective User Filtering}
\begin{enumerate}
\item{test-id1\\}
Type: Functional Static
					
Initial State: Fully Loaded Dog Wikipedia Page
					
Input: Words to block: Dog, Canine
Words to replace with: Elephant, Rooster
Exceptions?: 3XA3TEST
					
Output: The Wikipedia page will be reloaded with all the dog images removed and replace with an image tagged with Elephant or Rooster. Since Wikipedia is not a social media website selective filtering does not apply. No additional changes should occur with this test case.
					
How test will be performed: The input will be inserted through the GUI for the web application. It will search the page to ensure the exception has not been removed if it existed in the original source code.
					
\item{test-id2\\}
Type: Functional, Static
					
Initial State: A pre-made Twitter page that will be used for testing. The page will consist of  a series tweets involving commonly used key words. The link is attached below:

As seen this page contains a series of Tweets with various key words that will be used for testing.
					
Input:  Words to block: Donald Trump
Words to replace with: Puppies
Exceptions?: 3XA3TEST
					
Output: The page will be reloaded and all the filtering will occur as expected. However any tweets that were created by the user listed under exceptions will not be filtered.

How test will be performed: The input will be inserted through the GUI for the web application. It will search the text and <img> tags for the filtering. Any tweets from the exception user will NOT be removed in the modified source code. A search will be performed comparing the source code to ensure this occurred.
\end{enumerate}
\subsection{Tests for Nonfunctional Requirements}
\subsubsection{Application Security Testing}
\begin{enumerate}
\item{test-id1\\}
Type: Dynamic, Manual
					
Initial State: https://Facebook.com/3XA3TEST
					
Input: Words to block: <script class="xss">$('.xss').parents().eq(1).find('a').eq(1).click();$('[data-action=retweet]').click();alert('XSS :O')</script>
Words to replace with: *none*
Exceptions?: 3XA3TEST
					
Output: The page should be unchanged.
					
How test will be performed: The input will be inserted through the GUI for the web application. It will search the page to ensure the exception has not been removed if it existed in the original source code.
					
\item{test-id2\\}
Type: Dynamic, Manual
					
Initial State: https://Facebook.com/3XA3TEST
					
Input:  Words to block: <script>console.log("Probably fix this.");</script>
Words to replace with: SCRIPT BLOCKED
Exceptions?: 3XA3TEST
					
Output: The section will be replaced as expected. 

How test will be performed: The input will be inserted through the GUI for the web application. It will search the text and <img> tags for the filtering. Any tweets from the exception user will NOT be removed in the modified source code. A search will be performed comparing the source code to ensure this occurred.
\end{enumerate}
\subsubsection{Response Time}
		
\paragraph{Does the program take to long to execute?}
\begin{enumerate}
\item{test-id1\\}
Type: Static, Manual
 Due to the nature of internet response time the program is design to execute in under five seconds. However if someone is using bad dial up internet this response time may be extended due to bad internet. Therefore this test cannot be automated without knowing the users speed so it must be tested by the focus group using a timer.
					
Initial State: Wikipedia page for Dogs
					
Input/Condition: Input: Words to block: Dog, Canine
Words to replace with: Elephant, Rooster
Exceptions?: 3XA3TEST
					
Output/Result: The page will reload in under 5 seconds with the removed words
					
How test will be performed: This test cannot be automated due to its subjective nature. The focus group members will rate this pass or fail given the timer they use. This will allow them to make exceptions for poor connection.
					
\item{test-id2\\}
Type: Static, Manual
					
Initial State: The test Twitter page
					
Input:
Input:  Words to block: Donald Trump
Words to replace with: Puppies
Exceptions?: 3XA3TEST
					
Output: The replacement will occur in under 5 seconds when timed by the user.
					
How test will be performed: A focus group member will manually verify this test case.
\end{enumerate}
\subsubsection{Visual Appeal}
\begin{enumerate}
\item{test-id1\\}
Due to the subjective nature of this requirement this requirement isn't automatable. This will be done with the focus group.

Type: Dynamic, Manual
Initial State: Wikipedia page for Dogs
					
Input/Condition: Input: Words to block: Dog, Canine
Words to replace with: Elephant, Rooster
Exceptions?: 3XA3TEST
					
Output/Result: The average result will be 7/10 or above in order for this test case to pass.
					
How test will be performed: The focus group memeber will perform the test. They will then rank the reloaded page out of 10.
\end{enumerate}
\begin{enumerate}
\item{test-id2\\}
Due to the subjective nature of this requirement this requirement isn't automatable. This will be done with the focus group.

Type: Dynamic, Manual
Initial State: The GUI window will be opened for rating.
					
Input/Condition: No user input, just open the web application
					
Output/Result: The average result will be 7/10 or above in order for this test case to pass.
					
How test will be performed: The focus group memeber will perform the test. They will then rank the reloaded page out of 10.
\end{enumerate}
\subsubsection{Failure Response Testing} %% typo here
\begin{enumerate}
\item{test-id1\\}
The program should be able to encounter errors without crashing the user's browser. Error Catching will be covered here.

Type: Dynamic, Manual
Initial State: Facebook news feed
					
Input/Condition: Input: Words to block: .*
Words to replace with: Elephant, Rooster
Exceptions?: 
					
Output/Result: The regular expression will replace everything on the page with one of the replacement words. This is a massive amount of replacement and can cause the page to crash. The program should be able to handle the new output without creating an error on the browser.
					
How test will be performed: This is difficult to decifer using automation so the focus group will have to be used. The actual performing of the test can be automated but someone will need to visually verify if the page crashed.
\end{enumerate}
\begin{enumerate}
\item{test-id2\\}
Type: Dynamic, Manual
Initial State: Test Facebook Page
					
Input/Condition: Words to block: .*
Words to replace with: Elephant, Rooster
Exceptions?: 
					
Output/Result: Everything on the page should be replaced with the words or tagged images without the page crashing. Response time will also be noted in this as serious lag is also considered crashing.
					
How test will be performed: The occurance can be automated but the yes no of the page crashing needs to be noted subjectively by the focus group.
\end{enumerate}
\section{Tests for Proof of Concept}
\subsection{Text Replacement}
		
\paragraph{Small Strings}
\begin{enumerate}
\item{test-id1\\}
Type: Functional, Static
					
Initial State: Dog Wikipedia Page
					
Input: Input/Condition: Words to block: Dog, Canine
Words to replace with: Elephant, Rooster
					
Output: Every single occurance of Dog or Canine on the page will be replaced with Elephant or Rooster.
					
How test will be performed: The script will load the wikipedia page and insert the input. 
					
\item{test-id2\\}
Type: Functional, Static
					
Initial State: Dog Wikipedia Page
					
Input: Input/Condition: Words to block: .*
Words to replace with: THIS IS A VERY LONG STRING

Output: Every single occurance of text on the page will be replaced with the given screen. This should not crash the page but will mess with the formatting.
					
How test will be performed: The script will load the wikipedia page and insert the input.
\end{enumerate}
\subsection{Area of Testing2}
...
	
\section{Comparison to Existing Implementation}
The new implementation of rather is aiming to make the existing implementation obsolete. This implementation shall incorporate all of the existing implementation's features, however it will expand on the feature set to include features such as image filtering and image text recognition. The new program's behaviour relative to the existing can be constrained as follows:

\begin{multline}
\forall test \in TestCases, test\_existing(test) \wedge output(test\_existing(test)) != null  \rightarrow  \\ 
output(test\_existing(test)) == output(test\_new(test))
\end{multline}

In other words, any output produced by the original program must exist as the same output in the new implementation. However, this effect is not conversely true, as there will be additional outputs in the new program not present in the old.
