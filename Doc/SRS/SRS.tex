This document describes the requirements for Rather.  The template for the Software
Requirements Specification (SRS) is a subset of the Volere
template~\citep{RobertsonAndRobertson2012}.

\section{Project Drivers}

\subsection{The Purpose of the Project}

The purpose of the project is to revise an already existing extension for Google Chrome which acts as a text-to-image replacement tool. The revised version will be more versatile, robust, and functional. The program's functionality will be expanded to most forms of social media, while simutaneously being more user friendly and dependable. 

\subsection{The Stakeholders}

\subsubsection{The Client}

\subsubsection{The Customers}

\subsubsection{Other Stakeholders}

\subsection{Mandated Constraints}

The project must respect user privacy; refrain from recording or storing any data from the user's social media feeds. Even if this is not done with malicious intent, it is wise to avoid this practice to ensure there is nothing contentious about the program. 

\subsection{Naming Conventions and Terminology}

The project will use a common naming convention for all files, functions, variables and constants. Files will be formally named with underscores instead of spaces. Functions will have no spaces, the first word is not capitalized, and all subsequent words are capitalized. Variables have no spaces, with all words capitalized. Constants are written in all capital letters 

\subsection{Relevant Facts and Assumptions}

User must be able to read, use a computer, and have a Facebook and/or Twitter account. User must also have Google Chrome installed, and have a basic understanding of how extensions work for said browser.

\section{Functional Requirements}

\subsection{The Scope of the Work and the Product}

\subsubsection{The Context of the Work}

\subsubsection{Work Partitioning}

\subsubsection{Individual Product Use Cases}

\subsection{Functional Requirements}

\section{Non-functional Requirements}

\subsection{Usability and Humanity Requirements}

\subsection{Performance Requirements}

\subsection{Operational and Environmental Requirements}

\subsection{Maintainability and Support Requirements}

\subsection{Security Requirements}

\subsection{Cultural Requirements}

\subsection{Legal Requirements}

\subsection{Health and Safety Requirements}

This section is not in the original Volere template, but health and safety are
issues that should be considered for every engineering project.

\section{Project Issues}

\subsection{Open Issues}

\subsection{Off-the-Shelf Solutions}

\subsection{New Problems}

\subsection{Tasks}

\subsection{Migration to the New Product}

\subsection{Risks}

\subsection{Costs}

\subsection{User Documentation and Training}

\subsection{Waiting Room}

\subsection{Ideas for Solutions}

\section{Appendix}

This section has been added to the Volere template.  This is where you can place
additional information.

\subsection{Symbolic Parameters}

The definition of the requirements will likely call for SYMBOLIC\_CONSTANTS.
Their values are defined in this section for easy maintenance.
