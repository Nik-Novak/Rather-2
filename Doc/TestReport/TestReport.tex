Security Testing Results:
\\
User inputting a script:
\\
Originally this test case was performed on Twitter. We have since limitted it to Facebook and this test has been modifed which is reflected in the Test Plan document. When script tags are inputted in the list option nothing happens. Chrome extensions auto block all scripts as input to prevent malicious content. Both test cases contained script tags and passed the manual testing.
\\
Response Time:
\\
Test-Id-1: \\
This test was performed on Erin's internet as it is the most consistent connection of the group members. Test 1 passed. Results were outputted in under one second. \\
Test-Id-2: This test was performed on the Mac Secure network. This Wifi connection is the least consistent and slowest and was used as an edge case to see how the application responds. Test case 2 passed. Results were outputted in 3 seconds and loaded at the same rate as the original page.\\
Visual Appeal: \\
See Usability section for survey results. Average results was above 7. Test passed. \\
Failure Response Testing: \\
Test-Id-1: \\
The application still accepts regular expressions but it does not crash the page when used. The code limits the replacement to just the news feed/ page feed so there are no issues created in the side bar or chat bar. Test case passed. \\
Test-Id-2:\\
The page did not crash. Test case passed.
