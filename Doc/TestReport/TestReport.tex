This document is a report of Test cases performed in document Test Plan. The section and test case id is referenced along with whether the test case passed or failed. If context is needed it is given with the test case. The testing of the web application was performed using Q-unit on portions of the code along with manual testing. The manual testing was performed by both the group members and a focus group consisting of ten students. These members are in a variety of majors and half do not have any technical knowledge or experience.
\section{Functional Requirements Evaluation}
\\
Can the program search and replace Text?: \\
Test-Id-1:\\
This test case was automated and is described in more detail below. Test case passed.\\
Test-Id-2\\
This test case was automated and is described in more detail below. Test case passed.
\\
\\
Image Replacement: \\
Test-Id-1: \\
This test was performed manually by team members. (It's hard to automate whether an image replaced correctly through unit testing.) This test cased passed.\\
Test-Id-2:\\
This test was performed manually by team members. The test case passed.\\
\\
Selective User Filtering: \\
Test-Id-1: \\
This test case passed. \\
Test-Id-2 \\
This test case passed. \\
\\

\section{Nonfunctional Requirements Evaluation}
\\
Security Testing Results:
\\
User inputting a script:
\\
Originally this test case was performed on Twitter. We have since limitted it to Facebook and this test has been modifed which is reflected in the Test Plan document. When script tags are inputted in the list option nothing happens. Chrome extensions auto block all scripts as input to prevent malicious content. Both test cases contained script tags and passed the manual testing.
\\
Response Time:
\\
Test-Id-1: \\
This test was performed on Erin's internet as it is the most consistent connection of the group members. Test 1 passed. Results were outputted in under one second. \\
Test-Id-2: This test was performed on the Mac Secure network. This Wifi connection is the least consistent and slowest and was used as an edge case to see how the application responds. Test case 2 passed. Results were outputted in 3 seconds and loaded at the same rate as the original page.\\
Visual Appeal: \\
See Usability section for survey results. Average results was above 7. Test passed. \\
Failure Response Testing: \\
Test-Id-1: \\
The application still accepts regular expressions but it does not crash the page when used. The code limits the replacement to just the news feed/ page feed so there are no issues created in the side bar or chat bar. Test case passed. \\
Test-Id-2:\\
The page did not crash. Test case passed.

\subsection{Usability}
This section of the testing was performed using a survey from our focus group. The survey consisted of the following questions: \\
Please Rank the follow on a scale of 1-10 \\
Application Appeal:  \\
Ease of Use:\\
Aethetic Appeal: \\
Does it crash anybrowser pages? (10 for no 1 for yes) \\
Would you reccomended this application? (10 for yes 1 for no) \\
Additional comments? \\

10 people were surveyed in total. The results were over all positive with the average value of the results described below.	\\

As shown above the average of each score is above 7. Each of these test cases pass.
\subsection{Performance}
Application performance testing was included in the functional and non-functional requirements. Performance time, malicious script handling, and error catching is included in these test. Each of these three sections had all of their test cases pass. The passing of these cases were integral to the performance of the application and were performed until they passed.
